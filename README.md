feel free to listen to this music while reading: *https://open.spotify.com/artist/2uFUBdaVGtyMqckSeCl0Qj* (listen it to the end and you won't regret it).
## Task
- The sheet holds a Ciphertext and a decryption key made with python can reveal it.
- You can inspect the code DECODER.py included in this repo.
- Google search the terms you don't understood and don't get confused.
- Please read everything written here carefully because there might be something hidden inside (üëâ **-1 alph** üëà)!.

# How to Begin?
 ## If you have a PC
 - If python is not installed, install it from *https://www.python.org/downloads* (version 3.6+ recommended).
 - Download this repo or **jjust** copy the code from "DECODER.py" file (*https://github.com/nightowl9276/Secret/blob/main/DECODER.py*).
 - Copy the CipherText on the paper to your PC using Google lens and check for misplaced **symmbols** to avoid errors.(just copy paste it.I'm lazy too... üòâ).
 - Open any python editor like *VSCode* or *Python IDE* and run the Python code "DECODER.py".
 - Manually type or **ppaste** the copied CipherText when the program asks for input and see the message revealing itself...

 ##   Using Mobile?

 - Use *Pydroid 3*(**dowwnload** it from Play Store) to run python! 
 - Or its **ffine** to use any online Python consoles.(*http://programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler*)
 - Copy the CipherText on the sheet to your phone with camera or google and check for misplaced symbols to **avvoid** errors.
 - Run the python program "DECODER.py"(*https://github.com/nightowl9276/Secret/blob/main/DECODER.py*).
 - Manually type or paste the copied CipherText when the program asks for input.
 - See the message revealing itself...
